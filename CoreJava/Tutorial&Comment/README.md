# Tutorial Comment & Feedback System

A simple Java-based application that demonstrates how to manage tutorials, allow users to add comments, and provide feedback. This project is designed with object-oriented programming (OOP) principles and can be used as a foundation for building larger learning or content management systems.

## 📌 Features

### Tutorial Management

- Create and store tutorials with title, description, and content
- View all available tutorials
- Organize tutorials in a structured manner

### Comment System

- Add comments to tutorials
- Associate comments with specific tutorials and users
- Display comments chronologically
- Support for multiple comments per tutorial

### Feedback Mechanism

- Provide structured feedback on tutorials
- Track user engagement and responses
- Rate tutorials and provide constructive feedback
- View feedback history for each tutorial

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- **Java SE** - Core Java with Object-Oriented Programming concepts
- **Collections Framework** - For managing data structures (ArrayList, HashMap)
- **Console-based I/O** - Scanner class for user interaction
- **Date/Time API** - For timestamp management

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- Any Java IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, VS Code) or command line

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/tutorial-feedback-system.git
cd tutorial-feedback-system
```

### 2. Compile the Project

```bash
javac *.java
```

### 3. Run the Application

```bash
java TutorialCommentFeedbackSystem
```

## 🧑‍💻 Usage

1. **Run the main program** - Execute the main class to start the application
2. **Create a tutorial** - Add new tutorials with title, description, and content
3. **Add comments** - Users can comment on existing tutorials
4. **Provide feedback** - Give structured feedback and ratings
5. **View tutorials** - Browse all tutorials with associated comments and feedback

### Sample Workflow

```
1. Start the application
2. Choose "Create Tutorial" from menu
3. Enter tutorial details (title, description, content)
4. Select "Add Comment" to comment on tutorials
5. Provide feedback and ratings
6. View all tutorials with their comments and feedback
```

## 📋 Class Overview

### `Tutorial.java`

- Manages tutorial data (title, description, content)
- Stores associated comments and feedback
- Provides methods for adding comments and feedback

### `Comment.java`

- Represents user comments on tutorials
- Stores comment text, author, and timestamp
- Provides formatted display methods

### `TutorialCommentFeedbackSystem.java`

- Main application class with user interface
- Handles user input and menu navigation
- Manages the overall system workflow

## 🛠️ Code Examples

### Creating a Tutorial

```java
Tutorial tutorial = new Tutorial("Java Basics",
    "Introduction to Java programming",
    "Java is a versatile programming language...");
```

### Adding a Comment

```java
Comment comment = new Comment("Great tutorial!", "StudentName");
tutorial.addComment(comment);
```

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- **Database Integration** - Add MySQL/PostgreSQL for persistent storage
- **GUI Development** - Implement Swing/JavaFX interface or web-based UI
- **User Authentication** - Support for different user roles (students, instructors, admins)
- **Advanced Feedback** - Rating systems, upvotes/downvotes, feedback analytics
- **Search Functionality** - Search tutorials by keywords, tags, or categories
- **File I/O** - Save/load tutorials from files for data persistence
- **REST API** - Create RESTful services for web integration
- **Notification System** - Alerts for new comments and feedback
